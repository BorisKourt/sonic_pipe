# Sonic Pipe

I couldn't wait for a new version of [sonic-pi-cli](https://github.com/Widdershin/sonic-pi-cli) or [sonic-pi-tool](https://github.com/lpil/sonic-pi-tool) following the release of Sonic Pi 4.0 so I quickly hacked a script that allows strings to be piped from the command line to the Sonic Pi Server.

The script is a proof of concept based on information gathered from the [Sonic Pi Forum](https://in-thread.sonic-pi.net/). Feel free to change anything and to push changes to the repo :). I don't pretend to replace or do better than the tools mentioned above. Use them if you can once they will be updated!

## Usage

The script requires **python-osc**. Once installed, simply run the main script `python3 sonic_pipe` or directly `python3 sonic_pipe/main.py` to start the barebones REPL.
