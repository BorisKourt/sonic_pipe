# Sonic Pipe

I couldn't wait for a new release of [sonic-pi-cli](https://github.com/Widdershin/sonic-pi-cli) or [sonic-pi-tool](https://github.com/lpil/sonic-pi-tool) following the release of Sonic Pi 4.0 so I quickly hacked together a script to pipe strings from the command line to the Sonic Pi Server.

This script is a proof of concept based on information gathered from the [Sonic Pi Forum](https://in-thread.sonic-pi.net/). Feel free to change anything and to push changes to the repo :).
